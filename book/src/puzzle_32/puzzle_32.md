# Puzzle 32: Bank Conflicts

## Why this puzzle matters

**Completing the performance trilogy:** You've learned GPU profiling tools in [Puzzle 30](../puzzle_30/puzzle_30.md) and understood occupancy optimization in [Puzzle 31](../puzzle_31/puzzle_31.md). Now you're ready for the final piece of the performance optimization puzzle: **shared memory efficiency**.

**The hidden performance trap:** You can write GPU kernels with perfect occupancy, optimal global memory coalescing, and identical mathematical operations - yet still experience dramatic performance differences due to **how threads access shared memory**. Bank conflicts represent one of the most subtle but impactful performance pitfalls in GPU programming.

**The learning journey:**

- **Puzzle 30** taught you to **measure and diagnose** performance with NSight profiling
- **Puzzle 31** taught you to **predict and control** resource usage through occupancy analysis
- **Puzzle 32** teaches you to **optimize shared memory access patterns** for maximum efficiency

**Why this matters beyond GPU programming:** The principles of memory banking, conflict detection, and systematic access pattern optimization apply across many parallel computing systems - from CPU cache hierarchies to distributed memory architectures.

> **Note: This puzzle is specific to NVIDIA GPUs**
>
> Bank conflict analysis uses NVIDIA's 32-bank shared memory architecture and NSight Compute profiling tools. While the optimization principles apply broadly, the specific techniques and measurements are NVIDIA CUDA-focused.

## Overview

**Shared memory bank conflicts** occur when multiple threads in a warp simultaneously access different addresses within the same memory bank, forcing the hardware to serialize these accesses. This can transform what should be a single-cycle memory operation into multiple cycles of serialized access.

**What you'll discover:**

- How GPU shared memory banking works at the hardware level
- Why identical kernels can have vastly different shared memory efficiency
- How to predict and measure bank conflicts before they impact performance
- Professional optimization strategies for designing conflict-free algorithms

**The detective methodology:** This puzzle follows the same evidence-based approach as previous performance puzzles - you'll use profiling tools to uncover hidden inefficiencies, then apply systematic optimization principles to eliminate them.

## Key concepts

**Shared memory architecture fundamentals:**

- **32-bank design**: NVIDIA GPUs organize shared memory into 32 independent banks
- **Conflict types**: No conflict (optimal), N-way conflicts (serialized), broadcast (optimized)
- **Access pattern mathematics**: Bank assignment formulas and conflict prediction
- **Performance impact**: From optimal 1-cycle access to worst-case 32-cycle serialization

**Professional optimization skills:**

- **Pattern analysis**: Mathematical prediction of banking behavior
- **Profiling methodology**: NSight Compute metrics for conflict measurement
- **Design principles**: Conflict-free algorithm patterns and prevention strategies
- **Performance validation**: Evidence-based optimization using systematic measurement
